A version of the manuscript with anotated links between all outputs and source scripts is included in this folder 
and named "IUCN multi threat MS with source info.docx". This document details what is the source of each value, table, figure listed in the manuscript

0_IUCN_threat_extraction2parallel.R
Script uses list of species in each red list category (downloaded from IUCN)
to download additional info from IUCN site throught mining of pages [0_IUCN_threat_extraction2.R]

1_IUCN_threat_extraction_merge_results.R
--merges all species individual threat info

2_merge_all_data.R
--Script creates mega matrix with all info for species with threat info

3_summary.R
--creates counts of non-climatic threats for relevant categories for factors of interest: 
IUCN status and for 1) all species, 2) climate change vulnerable and 3) non-climate change vulnerable species 
results are generally locatted at results\hists_and_counts
--creates figure 2 from manuscript
--creates t-test comparisons for climate change vulnerable and non-climate change vulnerable species located at results\ttests

4_collect_all_stats.r
--collects all info on non-climatic threats generated in first part of summary.R
--collects all t-test comparisons from summary.R into single table
--creates multiple composite bar graphs comparing number of non climatic threats by the various IV combinations located 
  under results/graphs/ included figure 3

5_graph_creation
--creates multiple barplots for data inspection at results\barplots
--creates metric for increase in number of non-climatic threats by climate vulnerability
--creates multiple composite histograms located at results/hists_and_counts/hist_for_*, including figure 1.

6_threat_augmentation_comparison.R
--essentially generalizes the calculation of the non-climatic threat increase to be applied for any given threat category. This is the basis for appendix 6.

7_number_of_assessments_and_year.r
--script makes a few statistical comparisons, including analysis to determine if there is a time dependence of 
climate change threat attribution for IUCN species listings. This includes figure in appendix 5.

8_anova_and_glm.r
--statistical tests for manuscript
