--First script uses list of species in each red list category (downloaded from IUC)
to download additional info from IUCN site throught mining of pages [0_IUCN_threat_extraction2parallel.R]
--Second script summarizes extracted threat information for 1) all species, 2) climate change and 3) non-climate change threatened
species [1_summary.R]
--Third script makes graphical outputs of analyses [2_collect_all_stats.r]
--Remaining scripts make graphs, tables and statistical comparisons, including analysis to determine if there is a time dependence of 
climate change threat attribution for IUCN species listings
[3_threats and year.r; 4_anova_and_glm.R; 4_graph_creation.R; 4_merge_all_data.R]
--Last script replicates the analysis but using other threat categories as focus instead of climate vulnerability [4_threat_augmentation_comparison.R]

A version of the manuscript with anotated links between all outputs and source scripts is included in the folder and named "IUCN multi threat MS with source info.docx"
